Had less time to work on things this week but wanted to figure out how compute
shaders work.

This is a point cloud that calculates the Re(scalar electric field) of a standing 
wave inside of a Fabrey-Perot open resonator (FPOR) with a 20.69GHz signal coupled in.

This is an extension of an optical physics topic called Gaussian Beam Theory.
However the frequency passed into to FPOR is Quasi-optical.

(I will not go into this in class) This is the fundamental solution of the
axis-symmetric paraxial approximation to the Helmholtz equation.

The Helmholtz equation is the name given to the electromagnetic wave equation if
one assumes periodic time dependence.

The electromagnetic wave equation is a reformulation of Maxwell's equations 
assuming a region with no current or charge.

axis-symmetric meaning here that a 3D phenomena with cylindrical symmetry can 
reduced to 2D. The coordinates are z and r (cylindrical coordinates).
- z is the distance along the resonator (propagation axis)
- r is the distance from the propagation axis

Anyways, this is what my research is on so it made sense to do as I have not
visualized the standing wave yet.
